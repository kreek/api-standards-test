# Errors

!!! success "Guidance"
    - Error fields **should** follow [RFC 7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807#section-3.1)
    - An operation **should** be able to return multiple errors in one response.
    - The `status` field **should** match the HTTP status code being returned.
    - The `title` field **should** be the generic class of the error and consistent across the API.
    - The `detail` field **should** be specific to the error at hand.
    - If an error is in the request, a `source` field **should** point to it.

## Required Errors

Returning reliable, consistent, and descriptive errors from responses is crucial
for maintaining an API's usability as it facilitates quicker diagnosis and mitigation
of issues by both consumers and API teams. Lighthouse has two sets of error status
codes for standardized error reporting. One of the sets contains standard error
status codes, and API teams must include them in all endpoints. The other set contains
error status codes related to errors that occur upstream. If the API depends on
upstream services, teams must use both sets of error codes.

The table below contains the required error status codes that all APIs must use.

| Status Code | Description           |
| :---------- | :----------           |
| 400         | Bad Request           |
| 401         | Unauthorized          |
| 403         | Forbidden             |
| 404         | Not Found             |
| 429         | Too Many Requests     |
| 500         | Internal Server Error |

If your API has endpoints dependent on upstream services, you must also include
the following error status codes.

| Status Code | Description           |
| :---------- | :----------           |
| 502         | Bad Gateway           |
| 503         | Service Unavailable   |
| 504         | Gateway Timeout       |

For `5xx` level errors returned from upstream services, error mapping must be implemented
so that your API returns the desired error responses to the consumer and does not
just pass along the error responses from the upstream services. This must be done
to ensure that the consumer does not receive system details or other sensitive information
about the upstream services.

The section, [Choosing an error code](#choosing-an-error-code) describes these error
codes in more detail and can provide assistance with selecting the correct error
codes.

## Error Schemas

The error schema should match that of the [information model](../general-guidelines/data-interchange.md#information-models)
you are using. This guide recommends using [JSON::API](https://jsonapi.org/) unless
an industry-specific format like [FHIR](http://hl7.org/fhir/) is required. We recommend
JSON::API because it has a well thought-out, extensible, and relatively simple error
model.

An example of a JSON::API-formatted 422 'Unprocessable Entity' error is:

```json title="422 Unprocessable Entity"

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "422",
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/isRefillable" },
      "title": "Invalid Attribute",
      "detail": "isRefillable must be a boolean value."
    }
  ]
}

```

FHIR has a different error schema [(OperationOutcome resource)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/operationoutcome.html).
An example is:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "id": "searchfail",
  "text": {
    "status": "generated",
    "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n<p>The &quot;name&quot; parameter has the modifier &quot;exact&quot; which is not supported by this server</p>\n</div>"
  },
  "issue": [
    {
      "severity": "fatal",
      "code": "code-invalid",
      "details": {
        "text": "The \"name\" parameter has the modifier \"exact\" which is not supported by this server"
      },
      "location": [
        "http.name:exact"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Multiple errors

Operations should be able to return multiple errors and providers should return
errors for all the issues with the request at once. For example, if 2 fields are
invalid, return both so the consumer is aware of all the issues that must be corrected,
instead of raising an error once the first invalid field is processed. If the error
statuses are different but have the same hundredth, for example, both are `4xx`,
return the base generic value (`400`). If the errors have mixed hundredth values
return a `500`.

```json title="422 Unprocessable Entity"

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "422",
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/isRefillable" },
      "title": "Invalid Attribute",
      "detail": "isRefillable must be a boolean value."
    },
    {
      "status": "422",
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/contactEmail" },
      "title": "Invalid Attribute",
      "detail": "contactEmail must be a valid email address."
    }
  ]
}

```

## Choosing an error code

Choosing the correct HTTP status code for an error can be confusing. With VA APIs,
the error will originate from one of three sources: from the consumerâ€™s request;
an upstream service the API depends on; or the API itself, such as the web application
and its components.

- Request errors: Issues caused by requests are a flavor of a `400` error (`4xx`).
- Upstream errors: Errors from upstream services are `502`, `503`, or `504`.
- Application errors: Always return a `500`.

The Lighthouse gateway will handle some of these errors for you. Within the 4xx
range, the gateway handles the authorization and authentication errors (`401` and
`403`) as well as the rate limiting errors (`429`). The gateway will also handle
your service being unavailable (`503`) or failing to respond to a request in time
(`504`).

The flowchart below can help you decide which HTTP status code to return for an
error.
